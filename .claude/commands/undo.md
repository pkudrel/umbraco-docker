# Undo Last Operation

I'll help you rollback the last destructive operation performed by CCPlugins commands.

## Recovery Options

I'll check for available recovery methods:

**1. Git-based Recovery**
- Check uncommitted changes
- Review recent commits
- Identify safe restore points

**2. Project Backups**
- Look for `undo/backups/` in your project
- Check for operation-specific backups
- Verify backup integrity

**3. Change Analysis**
- Show what was modified
- Identify scope of changes
- Suggest targeted recovery

## Recovery Process

Based on what I find, I can:

1. **Restore from Git** - If changes haven't been committed yet
2. **Use project backups** - If backups exist from previous operations
3. **Selective restoration** - Choose specific files to restore

I'll analyze the situation and suggest the safest recovery method.

If multiple restore options exist, I'll:
- Show you what each option would restore
- Explain the implications
- Let you choose the best approach

**Important**: I will NEVER:
- Add "Co-authored-by" or any Claude signatures
- Include "Generated with Claude Code" or similar messages
- Modify git config or user credentials
- Add any AI/assistant attribution to the commit

This ensures you can confidently undo operations without losing important work.
